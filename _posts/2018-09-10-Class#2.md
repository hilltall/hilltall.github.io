## (Class #2)

The document is an advertisement poster.  
It was made by the school council of Beecroft Garden primary school.  
In the center of the poster there is a drawing.  
It represents children holding hands around a circle – a planet or a table – with a tree in the middle.  
The drawing is probably the logo of the school council.  
In the poster there is a list of the qualities of a good school councillor.  

Maybe they made the poster because they need new candidates fot the next election. They also explain why the school council is important and how to apply.
