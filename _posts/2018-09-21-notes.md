Today is the last day (= the end) of summer. Summer is over (= finished).
A tip: go to the beach! Maybe it will be cold next week. It will probably rain. Sophia hates summer.

### Run: 3 definitions
  1. **Run**ning is a sport
  2. **Run** = be the boss / have power. ```The PM runs the UK.```
  3. **Run** = be a candidate. ```Yagoub is running for class representative.```
  
### Politicians and promises

- ```If I am elected I will upgrade (= improve) your life in the school.```
- ```If you vote for me I will change class hours.```
- ```If you vote for me I will organise class trips.``` 
- ```If you vote for me (= choose me, select me, elect me) I will fight for you.```
- ```When I am class representative I will represent the class/ I will have good ideas for the class.```
